Decentralized Governance Voting System


This is a decentralized cheating proof governance system.

How it Works?

Go to http://waffle.io/alqmte/duot-governance, Where you can

- Create a new Issue with either 
  - A suggestion of a new rule to add to the system.
    - Create a detailed suggestion of your request, with supporting evidence about how we should include that rule.
  - A report of a system inconsistency or loophole.
    - 
- Vote for an existing issue by incrementing the last vote label
  - Example, issue has label titled '+5', you want to vote for that issue, then remove "+5" tag and add "+6" tag.
  - Parameterizing our meta data to issues is our cheating proof technique, because all issue audits are saved, so we can verify each issue by running a script detecting cheating and spam cases
  - your most recent change is accepted, if not valid, the system bot user revokes your vote and mdify the tag to its correct value.

  - The code for this is the first is issue in the system.
  
  Any updates to this gensis document should be done via a ticket request first, and when approved person edits the file.
